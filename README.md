## Description

This application is a simple quiz that asks multiple choice questions about javascript to gauge the users knowledge. Once the quiz is started the user has a limited amount of time to answer the questions provided. If the user answers is wrong time is subtracted from the timer untill the quiz is complete, or the timer runs out. Once the quiz is finished the user can submit their high score to the scoreboard and it will be saved to local storage. The scoreboard can be viewed as well as cleared.
